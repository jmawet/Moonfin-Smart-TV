> **[Back to main Moonfin project](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client)**

Moonfin is a premium Jellyfin and Emby client built with the **Enact/Sandstone framework**, optimized for Samsung Smart TVs (Tizen) and LG Smart TVs (webOS). A single shared codebase powers both platforms with native video pipelines tuned for each.

## Features & Enhancements

Moonfin builds on the solid foundation of Jellyfin with targeted improvements for the TV viewing experience.

### Hardware-Accelerated Video Playback
- **Samsung AVPlay** (Tizen) and **Starfish/HTML5** (webOS) native video pipelines
- Smooth playback with proper hardware decoding for H.264, HEVC, HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision (where supported)
- Automatic DirectPlay to native transcode to hls.js fallback chain when a format isn't natively supported
- **Accurate per-TV codec profiles**: Your device reports exactly what it can play, so more content direct plays instead of burning server CPU on transcodes
- **Lossless audio passthrough**: DTS, DTS-HD, and Dolby TrueHD bitstreaming to a capable receiver, rechecked live when you switch audio outputs (experimental on webOS)
- **Wide device support**: Runs on Samsung TVs going back to 2016 (Tizen 2.4) through the latest models, and LG webOS 3 and up
- Enhanced player controls optimized for TV remote navigation

### Multi-Server & Unified Library Mode
- **Emby server support**: Sign in to Emby servers through Emby Connect, not just Jellyfin
- **Unified Library Mode**: Combine content from all connected Jellyfin servers into a single view
- Browse, search, and play content across multiple servers seamlessly
- Server badges show content origin when unified mode is enabled
- Cross-server playback with proper progress tracking per server
- Favorites, genres, and search aggregate results from all servers
- **Quick Connect and fast user switching** from your avatar, with auto-login and last-server memory

- **DVR Recordings**: Access and play back recorded content with a simple button press

### Improved Details Screen
- Metadata organized into clear sections: genres, directors, writers, studios, and runtime
- Taglines displayed above the description where available
- Cast photos appear as circles for a cleaner look
- Fits more useful information on screen without feeling cramped
- **Playlist Management**: Add any item to an existing playlist or create a new one directly from the details screen; reorder items with the left/right keys and remove them with Delete
- **Chapters, Collections & Media Versions**: Jump straight to chapters, see which collections a title belongs to, and pick between multiple versions of the same media
- **Extras & Special Features**: Behind-the-scenes clips, trailers, and other extras when the server has them

- **UI Scale**: Adjust the interface font size to suit your TV size and viewing distance
- **Media Bar Styles**: Pick from 5 different media bars (Moonfin, MakD, Gallery, Banner, and Bookshelf) to showcase featured content on the home screen, each with auto-advance and smooth transitions
- Item details show up right in the row, no need to open every title to see what it is
- Buttons look better when not focused (transparent instead of distracting)
- Better contrast makes text easier to read
- Transitions and animations feel responsive
- Consistent icons and visual elements throughout

### Performance
- **Automatic Performance Tuning**: Detects how capable your TV is and dials the heaviest visual effects up or down to match, so older sets stay responsive while newer ones keep the full look
- **Performance Mode**: Choose between Auto, High Quality, Balanced, and Performance to control the tradeoff yourself
- **Lighter visuals on weaker hardware**: Background blur is reduced or disabled where it would otherwise slow things down

### Localization
Moonfin speaks your language. Switch the app language right from Settings, with English, German, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), and Russian available.

Translations are managed on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonfin/smart-tv/), so anyone can help translate Moonfin into their language and new strings are picked up automatically.

## Installation

### Pre-built Releases

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Smart-TV/releases).

| Platform | File | Supported Devices |
|---|---|---|
| **Tizen Regular** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Regular_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2017+, square icon) |
| **Tizen Oblong** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Oblong_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2017+, oblong icon) |
| **Tizen Legacy** | `Moonfin_Tizen_Legacy_*.wgt` | Samsung Smart TVs (2016, Tizen 2.4) |
| **webOS** | `Moonfin_webOS_*.ipk` | LG Smart TVs (2016+, webOS 3.0+) |

### Sideloading: Samsung (Tizen)

The easiest way to install on Samsung TVs is using the **Jellyfin 2 Samsung** tool:

1. Download [Apps2Samsung](https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung) by [@PatrickSt1991](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991)
2. Enable Developer Mode on your Samsung TV:
   - Go to **Settings > General > System Manager > Developer Mode**
   - Turn Developer Mode **ON**
   - Enter your PC's IP address
   - Restart the TV
3. Run the tool, select the Moonfin `.wgt` file, enter your TV's IP address, and install

### Sideloading: LG (webOS)

1. Enable Developer Mode on your LG TV via the [LG Developer portal](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app)
2. Install the webOS CLI tools (`@webos-tools/cli`)
3. Set up your TV as a device: `ares-setup-device`
4. Install the IPK: `ares-install --device <your-tv> moonfin.ipk`

### Seerr Setup (Optional)

Seerr integration uses the **Moonfin Jellyfin Plugin** to proxy requests through your Jellyfin server, avoiding CORS and cookie issues on TV webviews.

1. Install the [Moonfin Plugin](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin) on your Jellyfin server
2. Configure the plugin with your Seerr server URL and API key in the Jellyfin admin dashboard
3. In Moonfin on your TV, go to **Settings > Plugin** and enable the integration. No additional URL or key entry is needed on the TV side, it connects through your Jellyfin server automatically

> **Note:** The plugin acts as a server-side proxy, so your TV only needs to reach your Jellyfin server. Seerr does not need to be directly accessible from the TV.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for Samsung: all variants (Regular, Oblong, Legacy) in one command
npm run build:tizen:all

# Build for Samsung: individual variants
npm run build:tizen         # Regular
npm run build:tizen:oblong  # Oblong (512x423 launcher icon)
npm run build:tizen:legacy  # Legacy (Tizen 2.4, no Smart Hub Preview)

# Build for LG (creates .ipk)
npm run build:webos

# Development server (Tizen mode)
npm run dev:tizen

# Development server (webOS mode)
npm run dev:webos
```

Build outputs:
- Tizen: `Moonfin_Tizen_<Regular|Oblong|Legacy>_<version>.wgt` in the project root
- webOS: `Moonfin_webOS_<version>.ipk` in the project root

## Development

This project uses **npm workspaces** and **Enact** to share a single React codebase across both platforms while keeping platform-specific code isolated.

├── package.json              # npm workspaces root
└── .eslintrc.js              # Shared ESLint config
```

### Platform Abstraction

Shared code in `packages/app/` never imports directly from `@enact/webos`, `tizen.*`, or `webapis.*`. Platform-specific behavior is isolated through runtime detection:

```js
import { isTizen, isWebOS, getPlatform } from './platform';
```

Services like video, storage, and device profiles use `getPlatform()` to dynamically import the correct platform implementation at runtime.

### Developer Notes
- **Enact/Sandstone** provides TV-optimized UI components and Spotlight navigation
- **Tizen**: AVPlay API for video, `tizen.tvinputdevice` for remote keys
- **webOS**: Shared HTML5 video element with `audioTracks` API, Luna service calls for storage
- Packaged apps (`.wgt` / `.ipk`) bypass CORS restrictions
- Cross-origin cookies don't persist in either platform's webview, use API keys instead
- UI changes should be tested on actual TV hardware when possible
